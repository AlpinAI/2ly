**AI Tools Platform. Connect any agent to any tool centrally.**

## Core Problem

AI development suffers from tool fragmentation and poor visibility. Each framework has different tool interfaces, requiring duplicate integration work. Deploying the same tool across LangChain, Langflow, and n8n means building separate connectors. 

Meanwhile, enterprises have no centralized way to monitor tool usage, optimize costs, or understand agent-tool relationships across their systems.

## How 2LY Solves It

By decoupling agent logic from tool management, we provide a unified layer to:

- **Support** any framework, such as LangChain, Langflow, n8n, or your custom solution
- **Connect** all agents to MCP servers, APIs, and custom tools universally
- **Deploy** anywhere - self-hosted, cloud, or hybrid with distributed runtimes
- **Manage** tool deployment, monitoring, and scaling independently from agent logic
- **Monitor** all agent-tool interactions with comprehensive observability
- **Optimize** tool efficiency and costs through context engineering and analytics

Empowering AI builders to focus on agent logic while 2LY handles the tool infrastructure.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+), Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlpinAI/2ly.git
cd 2ly
npm run start
```

Access dashboard at **http://localhost:8888**

### Connect Your First Agent
1. Initialize your instance
2. Connect an agent or create an empty one
3. Browse available tools in the MCP server catalog or add your own
4. Assign tools to your agent
5. Trigger your agent - it has now access to the tools
5. Monitor agent-to-tool interactions and observability insights

## Architecture

2LY acts as both a proxy and intelligence layer between your agents and tools:

```
Your Agent ‚Üí 2LY Platform ‚Üí Tool Ecosystem
(LangChain)   (Proxy +       (MCP Servers)
(Langflow)     Intelligence)  (REST APIs)
(n8n)         (Observability) (Functions)
(Custom)
```

**Core Components:**
- **Runtime** - Isolated execution environments for agents and tools with performance monitoring
- **Protocol Gateway** - MCP-to-HTTP translation with request/response tracking
- **Agent Connectors** - Framework-specific integration libraries
- **Intelligence Engine** - Usage analytics, cost optimization, and relationship mapping
- **Management Dashboard** - Tool deployment, monitoring, and observability insights


## Universal Tool Ecosystem

2LY supports any tool type - no vendor lock-in, no proprietary limitations.

### MCP Servers (Available Now)
- **Native Anthropic Registry Integration** - 50+ community servers (filesystem, GitHub, database, and more) with full observability
- **Custom MCP Servers** - Deploy your proprietary servers with complete analytics and monitoring

### REST APIs (Coming Q4 2025)
- **Direct API Integration** - Wrap any HTTP endpoint with authentication and usage tracking
- **Response Transformation** - Standardized outputs with performance metrics

### Custom Functions (Coming Q4 2025)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Functions** - Deploy custom business logic with execution analytics
- **Integration Adapters** - Connect any system with relationship mapping and cost tracking
