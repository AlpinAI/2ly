# One Platform. Any Agent. All Tools.

**2LY is the infrastructure layer for AI agent tooling.**

Stop rebuilding the same tools for every agent framework. 2LY gives you a private tool registry with embedded runtimes that works across any agent environment—whether you're using LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, or building custom agents.

## ✨ Why 2LY?

### ⚡ Ship Faster
Connect your agents to MCP servers, REST APIs, or custom functions through one unified interface. Tools run in isolated, secure runtimes—no dependency conflicts, no environment setup headaches.

### 🔧 Your Tools, Your Registry
Unlike platforms that lock you into their tool marketplace, 2LY lets you build and manage your own private catalogue. Import existing tools, wrap your internal APIs, or create custom functions—you control what's available to your agents.

### 👁️ Stay in Control
Built-in observability shows you exactly how your agents interact with tools. Track usage, debug failures, and optimize performance from a single dashboard.

### 🏠 Own Your Stack
Self-hosted and open source. Your tools, your infrastructure, your data.

> Currently supporting **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with REST APIs and coded functions in active development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlpinAI/2ly.git
cd 2ly
npm run start

## 🌐 Distributed Architecture

Unlike traditional gateways that proxy HTTP requests to fixed endpoints, 2LY uses message-based pub-sub where runtimes register dynamically from anywhere. Agents publish requests to topics; the broker routes to available runtimes regardless of location (cloud, edge, behind NAT). Message persistence and async communication enable fan-out queries, automatic failover, and zero-downtime deployments without orchestration code.

### Key Components

1. **Runtimes** - Lightweight execution environments that run services anywhere (cloud, edge, on-premise)
2. **Registry & Discovery (Dgraph)** - Graph database storing runtime capabilities, tool schemas, and deployment topology
3. **Message Broker (NATS)** - Handles all agent-to-runtime communication through pub-sub messaging and complete decoupling of agent and runtime locations
4. **Backend** - Orchestrates runtime lifecycle, enforces routing policies, provides authentication, rate limiting, and observability
5. **User Interface** - Workspace for configuration, management and monitoring of tools and runtimes
