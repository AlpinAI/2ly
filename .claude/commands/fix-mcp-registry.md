1. Start by running

```bash
cd packages/frontend codegen:mcp-registry
```

Which is updating the typings based on https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/openapi.yaml

2. Analyze the changes from previous working state

Take time to understand the changes of API and the impact on this application. The API is mainly consumed in packages/frontend/src/services/mcpRegistry.service.ts

3. Fix the code to align with new API

4. Run `/code-quality frontend allow-non-empty-gitÂ´ command to ensure that you didn't introduce typing, linting or testing issues.
