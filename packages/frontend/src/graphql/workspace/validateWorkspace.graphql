# Validate Workspace Access
# WHY: Verify user has access to the workspace in the URL before loading app.
# Used by WorkspaceLoader to prevent unauthorized workspace access.
# Uses workspaceMCPTools query which returns Workspace if user has access.

query ValidateWorkspace($workspaceId: ID!) {
  workspaceMCPTools(workspaceId: $workspaceId) {
