Set up a local environment for contributing to 2LY.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- Git
- Docker

## Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/2ly.git
cd 2ly
```

### 2. Install and Start

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Application runs at http://localhost:8888

## Workflow

### Create Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```
packages/
  backend/      # GraphQL API
  frontend/     # React UI
  runtime/      # MCP runtime
  common/       # Shared code
  twoly/        # Python SDK
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: Ports 8888, 4000, 4222 must be available
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is running
- **Node version**: Use Node.js 22+
