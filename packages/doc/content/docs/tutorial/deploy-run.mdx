## Step 1: Runtime Deployment

### Default Configuration

By default, your agent and tool are automatically linked and deployed to the **Main Runtime** using the Docker image deployment:

- **Agent Connection**: Your agent runs with embedded 2LY runtime
- **Tool Deployment**: GitHub MCP server deploys to Main Runtime Docker container
- **Automatic Linking**: Agent and tool are connected automatically

### Alternative Runtime Options

You can shift deployment to other runtimes if needed:
- **Local**: Different local Docker configurations
- **Remote**: Cloud infrastructure deployment
- **Edge**: Edge computing nodes

For this workflow, the Main Runtime handles everything seamlessly.

## Step 2: Execute Agent Command

### Run Your Agent

Now test your toolflow by running your agent with a specific prompt:

1. **Open Your Agent Framework** (LangChain, N8N, or LangFlow)
2. **Input Test Prompt**: Use this command:
   ```
   "Stay updated about 2LY by starring the repository https://github.com/AlpinAI/2ly"
   ```
3. **Execute Command**: Run your agent with this prompt

Your agent should process this request and use the GitHub tool to star the 2LY repository.

## Step 3: Monitor Execution

### Access Monitoring Dashboard

1. **Go to Monitoring**: Navigate to the Monitoring section in 2LY dashboard
2. **Validate Tool Interaction**: Confirm that:
   - Your agent called the GitHub tool
   - The tool performed the repository action
   - The request completed successfully

You should see the agent-to-tool interaction logs showing the successful execution of your command.

### Tutorial Complete

Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first toolflow:

✅ Agent connected to 2LY and processed the request
✅ GitHub tool executed the action 
✅ Monitoring shows successful interaction


## Next Steps

Your toolflow is ready to scale! You can now:

- **Add More Tools**: Configure additional MCP servers, APIs, or coded functions
- **Deploy to Production**: Switch to Remote or Edge runtime for team access
- **Build Complex Workflows**: Create multi-agent coordination and tool chaining
- **Monitor and Optimize**: Track usage patterns and performance metrics
