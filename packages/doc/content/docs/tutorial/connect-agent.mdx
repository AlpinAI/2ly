Connect your AI agent to 2LY's platform using one of the supported integrations.

## Step 1: Create Your Agent Project

**Important**: Start by creating a new project in your chosen agent framework first.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="LangChain">
    Create a new Python project and set up your environment:

    ```bash
    # Create new Python project
    mkdir my-2ly-agent
    cd my-2ly-agent
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install twoly langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv
    ```

    Create your agent file:

    ```python
    # agent.py
    from twoly import TwolyMCP
    from langchain.agents import create_react_agent
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    async def create_agent():
        async with TwolyMCP("my-agent") as mcp:
            # Get tools from 2LY
            tools = await mcp.get_langchain_tools()
            
            # Create your agent
            llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
            agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
            
            return agent
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="N8N">
    1. **Open N8N**: Navigate to http://localhost:5678
    2. **Create New Workflow**: Click "New workflow"
    3. **Add Webhook Node**: 
       - Drag "Webhook" node to canvas
       - Set HTTP Method: POST
       - Copy the webhook URL
    4. **Add HTTP Request Node**:
       - Connect to webhook node
       - Configure for 2LY API calls
    5. **Add AI Node**: Choose your LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
    6. **Save Workflow**: Give it a descriptive name
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="LangFlow">
    1. **Open LangFlow**: Navigate to http://localhost:7860
    2. **Create New Flow**: Click "New Flow"
    3. **Add Components**:
       - Drag LLM component (OpenAI/Anthropic)
       - Add HTTP component for 2LY integration
       - Connect components with flow logic
    4. **Configure 2LY Connection**:
       - Set API endpoint to your 2LY instance
       - Configure authentication if needed
    5. **Test and Save**: Verify the flow works correctly
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Step 2: Connect Agent to 2LY

Once your agent project is created, connect it to 2LY through the web interface.

### Access 2LY Dashboard

1. **Open 2LY**: Navigate to http://localhost:8888
2. **Go to Agents**: Click on the "Add Agents" section in the navigation
3. **Select Agents**: Select your framework

### Agent Connection Process

The connection process currently involve a one-time code config in your agent. You can do it directly by copy/paste it:

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="LangChain">
    - When your Python agent runs with `TwolyMCP("my-agent")`, it automatically appears in the 2LY dashboard
    - No configuration needed in 2LY - the connection is automatic
    - The agent will show up with the name you specified (e.g., "my-agent")
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="N8N">
    - Your N8N workflow connects to 2LY via HTTP requests
    - The workflow appears when it makes its first API call to 2LY
    - Connection is established through webhook interactions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="LangFlow">
    - LangFlow connects through API integration
    - Agent appears when the flow executes and calls 2LY endpoints
    - Connection is managed through the flow configuration
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Step 3: Verify Connection

### Connection Verification

Once your agent is connected, you will see it appear on the right side of the workflow screen.

### Quick Test

Test your agent connection:
- **LangChain**: Run `python agent.py` locally
- **N8N**: Trigger your workflow via webhook
- **LangFlow**: Execute your flow in the interface

### Troubleshooting

If your agent doesn't appear:
- Ensure your agent code is running
- Check 2LY is accessible at http://localhost:8888
- Review agent logs for connection errors

## Next Steps

Your agent is now connected to 2LY! Next steps:

1. **[Connect Tools](/your-first-toolflow/connect-tool)** - Add MCP tools for your agent to use
2. **[Deploy and Run](/your-first-toolflow/deploy-run)** - Link tools to agents and test execution  
3. **[Agent Integration Guides](/agent-integrations/langchain)** - Platform-specific documentation

## Key Points to Remember

- **No 2LY Configuration**: Agents connect directly without needing setup in 2LY
- **Automatic Discovery**: Connected agents appear automatically in the dashboard
- **Framework Agnostic**: LangChain, N8N, and LangFlow all work the same way
- **Ready for Tools**: Once connected, agents can access any configured tools

Your agent is ready to start using 2LY's tool ecosystem!
