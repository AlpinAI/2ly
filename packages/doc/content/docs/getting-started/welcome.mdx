description: Manage Your AI Tools Across All Agents
draft: false
---

2LY solves tool fragmentation in AI development by providing a unified infrastructure for managing tools across any agent framework.

## Key Features

**Tool Registry** - Centralized catalog of MCP servers, APIs, and custom functions available to all agents

**Agents** - Connect any AI framework through MCP protocol to access your tool ecosystem

**Playground** - Test tools in real-time for debugging

**Deployment** - Distribute tools across local, cloud, or edge runtimes with flexible execution

**Monitoring** - Track agent-tool interactions amongst all your workflows

## How It Works

    ToolRuntime --> Tools[Tools]

    style Agent fill:#e1f5fe
    style Tools fill:#e8f5e9
```

1. Agents connect as MCP clients through agent runtimes
2. Tool requests flow through NATS message bus
3. Backend routes to appropriate tool runtimes
4. Tools execute and return results
