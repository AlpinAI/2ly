This guide walks you through the 3-step onboarding process to get your first tool running. Complete this guide in **2 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

[Install 2LY](/getting-started/installation) and ensure it's running at http://localhost:8888

## Step 1: Create Your Workspace

When you first access http://localhost:8888, you'll be guided through workspace creation:

1. **Enter** your admin account details
2. **Create** your workspace

Your workspace is where all your tools, agents, and runtimes are managed. Think of it as your AI tool control center.

## Step 2: Follow the Onboarding

2LY provides a 3-step guided onboarding that walks you through the core concepts:

1. **Understanding Runtimes** - See how distributed execution environments work
2. **Connecting MCP Servers** - Learn how to add tool sources
3. **Creating Skills** - Discover how to curate tools for your agents

The onboarding is interactive and takes about 2 minutes. Don't skip it—it covers everything you need to know.

## Step 3: Connect an MCP Server

2LY comes with a selection of popular MCP servers ready to install:

**Recommended for first-time users:**

- **Filesystem** - Let agents read/write files
- **GitHub** - Connect to repositories
- **Weather** - Get weather data

**To connect a server:**

1. Click **Browse MCP Servers** in the Sources page
2. Select a server from the list (start with Filesystem for simplicity)
3. Configure any required parameters (e.g., allowed directories)
4. Click **Test Server** to verify it works
5. Click **Save** to activate it

You can add more MCP servers later from the [MCP Server Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Step 4: Test Your Tools

Before connecting your agent, verify your tools work:

1. Navigate to the **Tool Tester** page
2. Select a tool from your connected MCP server
3. Provide test inputs
4. Click **Test** and verify the output

This ensures everything is configured correctly before integrating with your agent.

## Step 5: Connect Your Agent

Now your skill is ready to be consumed by agents:

1. Navigate to the **Skills** page
2. Click **Connect** on your skill
3. Choose your agent framework:
   - **LangChain** - Copy the Python code snippet
   - **JSON** - Use the raw MCP configuration
   - **Other frameworks** - Use the MCP endpoint URL
4. Follow the framework-specific integration instructions

### Example: LangChain Integration

```python
from twoly import MCPAdapter

# Connect to 2LY
adapter = MCPAdapter(
    endpoint="http://localhost:3000/mcp",
    workspace_id="your-workspace-id",
    skill_id="your-skill-id"
)

# Use with LangChain
from langchain.agents import create_openai_tools_agent

agent = create_openai_tools_agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=adapter.get_tools()
)
```

See the [LangChain Integration Guide](/agents-integrations/langchain) for complete instructions.

## Verification

You should now have:

- ✅ Workspace created with admin account
- ✅ At least one MCP server connected
- ✅ Tools tested and verified
- ✅ Agent integration code ready

## What Happens Next?

Now that you've completed the quick start, here's what to explore:

### Learn More About Tools

- [MCP Servers](/tools/mcp-servers) - Explore available MCP servers
- [Tool Capabilities](/tools/capabilities) - Understand what tools can do
- [API & REST](/tools/api-rest) - Connect to REST APIs
- [Coded Functions](/tools/coded-function) - Write custom tool code

### Agent Integrations

- [LangChain](/agents-integrations/langchain) - Complete LangChain setup guide
- [LangFlow](/agents-integrations/langflow) - Visual workflow builder
- [N8N](/agents-integrations/n8n) - Automation platform integration

### Deep Dives

- [Architecture](/core-concepts/architecture) - How 2LY works under the hood
- [Runtime Deployment](/deployment/runtime) - Deploy runtimes anywhere
- [Security](/deployment/security) - Secure your 2LY installation

### Production Deployment

Ready to deploy 2LY for production use?

- Scale runtimes across multiple environments
- Configure monitoring and observability
- Set up proper authentication and access controls
- Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

See the [Deployment Guide](/deployment/platform) for production setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't access localhost:8888?**

```bash
# Check if services are running
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f frontend

# Restart services if needed
docker compose restart
```

**MCP test fails?**

- Check directory permissions for filesystem-based servers
- Try `/tmp` instead of Desktop for testing
- Verify the MCP server configuration in the UI
- Check runtime logs: `docker compose logs tool-runtime`

**Tools not appearing in agent?**

- Ensure your agent is properly configured with the MCP endpoint
- Check that the skill includes at least one tool
- Verify the runtime is connected in the dashboard
