Tools are services that agents invoke to interact with external systems. Configure once in 2LY, use across all agents.

## Tool Types

### 1. MCP Servers
Pre-built tools following the Model Context Protocol standard. These are production-ready implementations maintained by the community, providing standardized interfaces for common integrations.

**Examples:** Filesystem, GitHub, PostgreSQL, Slack, Brave Search

### 2. API Integrations
Turn any REST API into a tool by wrapping HTTP endpoints. Configure authentication, request parameters, and response handling through the dashboard without writing code.

**Use for:** Internal APIs, third-party services, legacy systems, webhook consumers

### 3. Coded Functions
Deploy custom JavaScript or Python code directly as tools. Write proprietary business logic, data transformations, or specialized operations that don't fit standard APIs.

**Use for:** Business rules, data validation, custom calculations, workflow orchestration

## How Tools Work

When an agent invokes a tool:
1. Agent calls tool via MCP
2. Request routed through NATS
3. Runtime executes tool
4. Result returns to agent

Tools run anywhere: local, cloud, or edge.

## Benefits

- **Reusable**: Configure once, use across all agents
- **Consistent**: Same behavior for all agents
- **Centralized**: Manage in dashboard, not in code
- **Secure**: Centralized auth, no credential distribution
