Agents are AI systems composed of an LLM, prompts, and tools. 2LY decouples tools from agent logic through a gateway runtime, enabling centralized governance and scalable tool management across all agents.

## What are Agents?

Traditional agents bundle three components:
- **LLM**: Language model for reasoning (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
- **Prompts**: Instructions defining agent behavior
- **Tools**: Functions for external actions (APIs, databases, files)

2LY separates the tool layer from agent frameworks. Instead of integrating tools directly into each agent, agents connect as MCP clients to a runtime that manages tool access, authentication, and execution centrally. This architecture allows you to configure tools once and use them across any agent framework.


## How Agents Work

1. Runtime starts and registers with backend via NATS
2. Backend sends available tools to runtime
3. Agent lists tools from runtime
4. Agent calls tool → routed via NATS → executes → returns result


## Benefits

- **Dynamic Discovery**: Add/remove tools without changing agent code
- **Centralized Config**: Manage tools in dashboard, not in code
- **Distributed**: Access tools anywhere (local, cloud, edge)
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any MCP-compatible framework
