n8n workflows connect to Skilder through the **MCP Client Tool** node, providing access to your configured tools via the MCP protocol.

## Overview

Integration uses n8n's MCP Client Tool node to:
- Discover and load tools from Skilder runtime
- Execute tool calls through MCP protocol
- Handle authentication and routing automatically

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Skilder is running
npm run start

# n8n installed and running
# Visit http://localhost:5678
```

### Add MCP Client Tool Node

1. Open your n8n workflow
2. Add **MCP Client Tool** node from the sidebar
3. Configure the MCP server:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server": "http://localhost:7801",
  "runtime": "@skilder-ai/runtime"
}
```

4. Connect the MCP node to your workflow components

## Basic Workflow

```
Trigger → MCP Client Tool → Process Data → Output
```

The MCP Client Tool node discovers all tools from your Skilder workspace and makes them available within the workflow.

## Configuration

### MCP Server Settings

- **Type**: Must be "mcp"
- **Server URL**: Your Skilder MCP endpoint (default: `http://localhost:7801`)
- **Runtime**: Package name `@skilder-ai/runtime`

### Environment Variables

```bash
export NATS_SERVERS="nats://localhost:4222"
export WORKSPACE_ID="my-workspace"
```

## Example Workflow

### Automated File Processing

```
Schedule Trigger → MCP: read_file →
Process Content → MCP: write_file →
Send Notification
```

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Run workflow on schedule
2. **MCP: read_file**: Read file using Skilder filesystem tool
3. **Process Content**: Transform or analyze data
4. **MCP: write_file**: Save results using Skilder filesystem tool
5. **Send Notification**: Alert via email/Slack

## Troubleshooting

**MCP Connection Failed**
```bash
# Verify Skilder services
docker-compose ps

# Check runtime endpoint
curl http://localhost:7801/health
```

**Tools Not Loading**
- Verify server URL in MCP Client Tool node
- Check tools are configured in Skilder dashboard
- Ensure Skilder runtime is connected

**Workflow Execution Issues**
- Check n8n execution logs
- Verify tool permissions in Skilder dashboard
- Test tools individually in Skilder playground
