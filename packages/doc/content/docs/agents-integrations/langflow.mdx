Langflow workflows connect to Skilder through the **MCP Connect** component, providing access to your configured tools via the MCP protocol.

## Overview

Integration uses Langflow's built-in MCP Connect component to:
- Discover and load tools from Skilder runtime
- Execute tool calls through MCP protocol
- Handle authentication and routing automatically

**Current Limitation**: Langflow allows only one MCP server connection named "Skilder" per workflow. We're developing a custom component to unlock full platform capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Skilder is running
npm run start

# Langflow installed and running
# Visit http://localhost:7860
```

### Add MCP Tools Component

1. Open your Langflow workflow
2. Add **MCP Tools** component from the sidebar
3. Configure connection:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
    "Skilder": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@skilder-ai/runtime"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NATS_SERVERS": "nats://localhost:4222",
        "RUNTIME_NAME": "My Agent"
}
```

4. Connect MCP output to your agent/chain components

## Basic Workflow

```
MCP Connect (Skilder) → Tool Caller → Agent → Output
```

The MCP Connect component discovers all tools from your Skilder workspace and makes them available to downstream components.


## Current Limitations

**Single MCP Constraint**: Langflow's current architecture limits connections to one MCP server per workflow. This means:
- Only one "Skilder" MCP Connect allowed per workflow
- Cannot partition tools across multiple MCP instances
- Tool discovery includes all workspace tools

**Workaround**: Assign all required tools to a single agent in the Skilder dashboard to manage which tools are available to workflows.

## Coming Soon

We're building a custom Langflow component that will:
- Support multiple Skilder MCP connections
- Provide advanced routing and caching
- Add real-time tool updates

## Troubleshooting

**MCP Connection Failed**
```bash
# Verify Skilder services
docker-compose ps

# Check MCP endpoint
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

**Tools Not Loading**
- Verify workspace ID is correct in MCP Connect component
- Check tools are configured in Skilder dashboard
- Ensure Skilder runtime is connected

**Single MCP Limit Errors**
- Remove duplicate MCP Connect components
- Use only one "Skilder" connection per workflow
- Consider splitting into multiple workflows if needed

**Workflow Execution Issues**
- Check Langflow logs for errors
- Verify tool permissions in Skilder dashboard
- Test tools individually in Skilder playground
