2LY runtime provides distributed execution environments for deploying AI agents and tools across Local Docker, Remote, and Edge infrastructure. Runtime manages service orchestration, resource allocation, and scaling for production-grade agent workflows.

## Runtime Architecture

2LY runtime orchestrates distributed agent execution:

- **Execution Isolation**: Containerized agent and tool deployment
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage allocation
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic agent-tool binding and communication
- **Load Distribution**: Scaling across runtime environments

## Runtime Types

2LY supports three runtime deployment patterns:

### Local Docker

Development and testing environment:

```bash
# Local development runtime
docker-compose up -d
```

**Features**:
- Hot-reload development workflows
- Local file system access for tools
- Single-node execution with full debugging
- Resource isolation with Docker containers

### Remote Runtime

Production cloud deployment:

```yaml
runtime:
  type: remote
  provider: aws|gcp|azure
  scaling:
    min_instances: 3
    max_instances: 50
    auto_scaling: true
```

**Capabilities**:
- Auto-scaling based on agent workload
- Multi-region deployment and failover
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Managed infrastructure and monitoring

### Edge Runtime

Distributed edge deployment:

```yaml
runtime:
  type: edge
  regions: [us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1]
  edge_caching: enabled
  latency_optimization: true
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced latency for global agent access
- Regional data processing compliance
- Edge caching for improved performance
- Distributed fault tolerance

## Runtime Deployment

### Container Orchestration

Runtimes deploy as managed containers:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Resource Configuration

Define runtime resource allocation:

```json
{
  "runtime_config": {
    "resources": {
      "memory": "2Gi",
      "cpu": "1000m",
      "storage": "10Gi"
    },
    "scaling": {
      "min_instances": 1,
      "max_instances": 10,
      "target_cpu_utilization": 70
    },
    "networking": {
      "load_balancer": true,
      "health_checks": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Secure runtime configuration:

```bash
# Runtime settings
RUNTIME_MODE=production
SCALING_ENABLED=true
RESOURCE_LIMITS=high

# Service endpoints
AGENT_REGISTRY_URL=https://agents.2ly.io
TOOL_REGISTRY_URL=https://tools.2ly.io
MCP_DISCOVERY_URL=https://mcp.2ly.io

# Security
JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
API_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${ENCRYPTION_KEY}
```

## Agent-Runtime Integration

### Agent Discovery

Agents automatically discover runtime services:

```python
from twoly import TwolyMCP

async def create_agent():
    async with TwolyMCP("my-agent") as mcp:
        # Runtime automatically provides available tools
        tools = await mcp.get_langchain_tools()
        
        # Agent-runtime binding managed by 2LY
        return create_agent(llm=your_llm, tools=tools)
```

### Runtime Binding

Runtime manages agent lifecycle and tool access:

- **Service Discovery**: Automatic agent-tool matching
- **Load Balancing**: Request distribution across runtime instances
- **Failover**: Automatic recovery from runtime failures
- **Resource Isolation**: Containerized execution boundaries

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Runtime Deployments

Deploy across multiple runtime environments:

```yaml
deployment:
  environments:
    - name: development
      runtime: local_docker
      resources:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1Gi
    - name: staging
      runtime: remote
      provider: aws
      region: us-east-1
      resources:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 2Gi
    - name: production
      runtime: remote
      provider: aws
      regions: [us-east-1, eu-west-1]
      scaling:
        auto_scaling: true
        min_instances: 5
        max_instances: 50
```

### Load Balancing

Configure traffic distribution:

```json
{
  "load_balancer": {
    "strategy": "round_robin",
    "health_checks": {
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/health",
      "interval": "30s",
      "timeout": "5s"
    },
    "sticky_sessions": false,
    "connection_draining": "30s"
  }
}
```

### Security Policies

Runtime security configuration:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "network_isolation": true,
    "encrypted_communication": true,
    "access_control": {
      "agent_authentication": "required",
      "tool_authorization": "capability_based"
    },
    "audit_logging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "retention_days": 90
    }
  }
}
```

## Operations

### Monitoring

Runtime performance and health tracking:

- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, and storage utilization
- **Agent Metrics**: Execution success rates, response times, error rates
- **Tool Metrics**: Tool invocation patterns and performance
- **Business Metrics**: Agent workflow success and completion rates

### Health Checks

Automated runtime health monitoring:

```javascript
// Runtime health endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    resources: {
      memory: process.memoryUsage(),
      cpu: await getCPUUsage()
    },
    services: {
      agent_registry: await checkAgentRegistry(),
      tool_registry: await checkToolRegistry(),
      database: await checkDatabase()
    }
  };
  
  res.json(health);
});
```

### Troubleshooting

**Runtime Issues**:

*Resource Exhaustion*:
- Monitor CPU and memory utilization patterns
- Implement resource limits and auto-scaling policies
- Analyze agent execution patterns for optimization

*Network Connectivity*:
- Verify runtime-to-registry communication
- Check agent-tool binding and discovery
- Validate load balancer and firewall configuration

*Performance Degradation*:
- Profile agent execution and tool invocation latency
- Optimize resource allocation and scaling triggers
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed tools

### Best Practices

**Resource Management**:
- Set appropriate resource limits for agent containers
- Implement auto-scaling based on workload patterns
- Monitor resource utilization and optimize allocation

**Security**:
- Use encrypted communication between runtime components
- Implement network isolation and access controls
- Regularly update runtime images and dependencies

**Performance**:
- Optimize agent code for runtime execution
- Implement caching for frequently used tools
- Monitor and tune garbage collection settings
