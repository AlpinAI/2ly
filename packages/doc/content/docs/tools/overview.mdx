2LY provides a centralized tool registry for managing AI agent capabilities at scale. Tools are configured, deployed, and orchestrated through a unified platform that abstracts away infrastructure complexity.

## What are Tools?

**Tools are executable services** deployed in 2LY runtimes that agents can invoke via MCP protocol:

- **Configured Services**: Pre-deployed with authentication and parameters
- **Runtime Deployed**: Running in managed execution environments
- **MCP Compatible**: Accessible through standardized protocol interfaces
- **Registry Managed**: Centrally tracked and monitored  

## Tool Types

2LY supports three tool implementation patterns:

1. MCP Servers
Standardized servers implementing Model Context Protocol for consistent tool interfaces.

2. API Integrations (coming soon)  
HTTP API endpoints wrapped with authentication and request/response mapping.

3. Coded Functions (coming soon)
Custom JavaScript/Python functions executed in managed runtime environments.

## Tool Registry

### Centralized Management
The tool registry provides:
- Real-time deployment status and health monitoring
- Access control and agent binding configuration
- Resource allocation and scaling controls

### Platform Independence
Tools operate independently of external dependencies:
- Source-agnostic deployment and execution
- Consistent API interfaces across tool types
- Self-contained configuration and state management
- Isolated runtime environments

## Management Interface

### Registry View
The tool registry displays:
- Tool metadata, type, and runtime information
- Deployment status and health indicators
- Agent bindings and execution metrics
- Administrative actions for configuration and deployment

### Tool Operations
Management features include:
- **Configuration**: Runtime parameters and authentication
- **Testing**: Endpoint validation and parameter testing
- **Monitoring**: Execution metrics and performance data
- **Deployment**: Runtime targeting and resource allocation

## Deployment Architecture

2LY tools are **pre-deployed services** in managed runtimes:
- Configured with authentication credentials and parameters
- Validated through automated testing pipelines
- Deployed to isolated execution environments
- Monitored for availability and performance

Agents access tools through MCP protocol with standardized interfaces and automatic service discovery.

## System Benefits

**Infrastructure Management:**
- Unified control plane for tool deployment and orchestration
- Automated scaling across Local Docker, Remote, and Edge runtimes
- Centralized monitoring and performance tracking

**Development Workflow:**
- Service discovery through MCP protocol
- Zero-configuration tool access for agents
- Abstracted runtime complexity

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Centralized governance and access control
- Resource optimization and cost tracking
- Scalable tool registry management


## Implementation Details

- **[MCP Servers](/tools/mcp-servers)** - Model Context Protocol server deployment
- **[API REST](/tools/api-rest)** - HTTP API endpoint configuration
- **[Coded Function](/tools/coded-function)** - Custom function runtime execution
- **[Capabilities](/tools/capabilities)** - Tool composition and grouping

The 2LY tool registry provides enterprise-grade tool management with automated deployment and centralized orchestration.
