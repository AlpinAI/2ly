 * Onboarding Step Definitions
 *
 * WHY: Centralized definitions for onboarding steps to keep them maintainable.
 * This allows adding new steps in future updates without duplicates.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Used by WorkspaceRepository to initialize onboarding steps
 * - Step IDs are used throughout the system for consistency
 * - Priority determines display order (lower number = higher priority)

 * 1. Install MCP server (add tools to workspace)
 * 2. Create tool set with tools (organize and manage tools)
 * 3. Connect tool set to an agent (integrate with AI workflows)
